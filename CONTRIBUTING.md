## Guiding philosophy
- Be light on configuration, preferring to have new components over complex APIs. Understand usage directly from the component name rather than derived from combinations of props.  
- Aim to solve a set of common problems, not all problems and variations.
- Be light on DOM detritus. Prefer to style existing children and containers rather than to create "wrappers" which can impact accessibility.
- Inline and override styles to reduce conflicts, dependencies, and declutter class names.
